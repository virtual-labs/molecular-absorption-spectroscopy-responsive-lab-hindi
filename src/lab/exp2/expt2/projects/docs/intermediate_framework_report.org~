* p5
** Introduction
   p5 is a drawing framework with similar goals as the Processing language. It
   helps in convenient implementation of interactivity and animation with the
   capacity to introduce objects and style them easily.
** Areas of Use
   There are many uses of p5, relevant to the context of creating a lab. These
   include:
   + Easier implementation of methods to HTML elements, seeing as they can be
     created from the script. This includes creating buttons, sliders,etc.
   + Rotation of objects is much simpler, seeing as direct rotation methods are
     available. Although JQuery can be used to achieve the same purpose, it
     should be noted that p5 helps integrate everything into one piece of code,
     and helps in simplifying it quite a bit.
   + Drawing simple shapes is possible through p5. This helps in creating
     schematics of new experiments, after which a graphical interface can be
     applied.
   + In various experiments with graphing, p5 provides graphing
     libraries (developer contributed). These, coupled with animations can help
     in plotting time dependent graphs were needed.
   + Use in experiments is possible as well, using multiple user created
     libraries.
   + There exist in built animation functions which run fast loops, thereby
     making repetition/iteration significantly easier.
** Drawbacks
   + p5 creates a canvas upon which drawing an animation can be done. This
     makes interactions with other HTML elements difficult.
   + It can be overcome by awkward methods of moving your canvas around, which
     could also lead to blocks in the case of complex animation.
